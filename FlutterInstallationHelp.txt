wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

Then I installed it using the Linux beta command (right click on the downloaded file, install using Linux beta). It installed it to this directory:

/usr/bin/

(Alternatively, for the install, I could've used this command:

sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb)

I ran flutter doctor -v and now it finds Chrome.

You may need to change the default resolution of the rEFInd menu (see refind.conf).

The background can easily be replaced by any .png-file with a resolution of 1920x1080.

Entries should be autodetected and shown with the proper icons.

Manual entries can be done via menuentry option (see refind.conf for examples).
